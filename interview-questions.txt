Interview Questions — Based on Pokedex/src/types.ts
=====================================================

Q1. What is a TypeScript `interface`, and why do we use one here?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A: An interface is a way to describe the shape of an object — it lists the
   property names and their types. We use interfaces here so TypeScript knows
   exactly what fields a Pokémon object has (id, name, height, etc.). If you
   accidentally try to access a field that doesn't exist, TypeScript will warn
   you before you even run the code.

Q2. Why does every interface in this file start with the `export` keyword?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: Without `export`, the interfaces only exist inside this file and cannot be
   used anywhere else. Adding `export` makes them available for other files to
   import. Without it, TypeScript treats the file as a plain script (not a module) and
   you get the error "File is not a module".

Q5. Why does `PokemonType` have a nested `type` object instead of just a `name` string?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A: The PokéAPI always wraps names in an object like `{ name: "fire", url: "…" }`
   so you can follow the URL to get more details. `PokemonType` mirrors that
   shape exactly. 

Q6. Why is `"official-artwork"` written with quotes in the interface?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A: The hyphen (-) in `official-artwork` makes it an invalid JavaScript
   identifier, so it cannot be used with dot notation. Wrapping it in quotes
   inside the interface definition, and accessing it with bracket notation in
   code (`sprites.other["official-artwork"]`), is the correct way to handle
   property names that contain special characters.

Q8. What is the difference between `PokemonListItem` and `PokemonData`?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A: `PokemonListItem` is the small summary you get from the list endpoint — just
   a name and a URL. `PokemonData` is the full detail object you get when you
   follow that URL. You typically fetch the list first to show all Pokémon names,
   then fetch the individual URL only when the user clicks on one.
